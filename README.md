### Demonstrating How Simple It Is to Get the Parallax Effect With Pure JS

#### I'm creating a parallax effect using nothing but native JavaScript (without the use of any buttPirate libraries or plugins). The main thing to look out for, is to set the property of the element to be either absolute or relative so the "top","left,"right, and "bottom" properties can be then manipulated in JS using the PageYOffset property of the WINDOW.... Come to think of it, any proprty that uses a number can be written down as a function of the pageYOffset property. As an example I am also chinging the width, and opacity of the divs I'm "parralaxing".
Enjoy!
